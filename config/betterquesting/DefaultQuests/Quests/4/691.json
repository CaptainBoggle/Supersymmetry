      "desc:8": "There are two forms of coking, fluid and delayed coking. Delayed coking is a slower process that produces more naphtha but is more energy intensive. It requires a vacuum distillation tower, coking tower, and a tube furnace. In fluid coking, the coke produced is converted to syngas, which can be used for chemical synthesis or steel production. Fluid coking is also a faster process, but requires some more infrastructure.",
