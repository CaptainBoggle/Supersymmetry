      "desc:8": "§cThermal cracking§r is a process that converts residues into lighter fractions using heat. It can be carried out in a roaster at lower efficiency and longer duration or in a cracker. There are three forms of this process: steam cracking, visbreaking, and coking.\n\n- Visbreaking is a milder form of thermal cracking which does not produce pure coke, but leaves behind a residue that can be used as a fuel oil blending component.\n\n- Coking is a severe form of thermal cracking that removes carbon from the fractions as coke, which can be used for metallurgy or as a fuel source.\n\n- Steam cracking is used mainly for lighter fractions to produce olefins (alkenes).",
